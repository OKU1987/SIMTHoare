# A Formalization of Hoare Logic for SIMT Programs

This repository holds a formalization of a Hoare Logic for SIMT programs [1] by using SSReflect/MathComp.

It also contains proof of correctness of a parallel prefix sum algorithm proposed by Blelloch [2].

## Requirements

- Coq 8.5
- SSReflect/MathComp 1.6
